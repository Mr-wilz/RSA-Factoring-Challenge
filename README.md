# RSA Factoring Challenge

## Challenge Description

Welcome to the RSA Factoring Challenge! This challenge is designed to test your skills in factoring large numbers, a crucial aspect of breaking the RSA cryptosystem.

### Task

Your task is to implement an efficient algorithm to factorize a given RSA modulus into its prime factors. The modulus `n` is a product of two large prime numbers (`p` and `q`), and your goal is to find and display `p` and `q`.
